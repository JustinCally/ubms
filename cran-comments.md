# Changes in version 1.1.0

In the previous version, there were CRAN warnings on Windows gcc10-UCRT about CR/CRLF line endings.
I have confirmed numerous times and in multiple ways (e.g. with dos2unix) that the Makevars file in the source package has LF line endings.
I do not get this warning when I build on my own Windows system, or on any other platform.
The source/header files reported to have CRLF line endings are auto-generated by rstantools at install time, possibly in a platform-specific way that results in CRLF line endings only when built on Windows (although again, this warning does not appear when I build on my Windows system).
Thus overall I believe these line ending warnings on Windows gcc10-UCRT can be ignored, but would appreciate any guidance otherwise.

## R CMD check results

# Changes in version 1.0.2

This release hopefully fixes all outstanding issues in CRAN checks

* Fixed 1 overly sensitive test that failed on Solaris
* Fixed use of unsigned int in C++ code that was causing clang-UBSAN errors
* Fix NOTE about plot method not in NAMESPACE on R-oldrel
* Fixed two tests so they check if object is "matrix" instead of "array" (failed on R-oldrel)
* Fixed test that wrongly assumed stringsAsFactors=FALSE (failed on R-oldrel)

## Test environments

* Local: Ubuntu 18.04 (R-release, R-devel with UBSAN), Windows (R-release)
* Github actions CI: Ubuntu 20.04 R-release, Ubuntu 20.04 R-devel, 
  Ubuntu 20.04 R-oldrel, Windows R-release, MacOS R-release

## R CMD check results (R-devel on Ubuntu 18.04)

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There were 2 NOTEs:

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is 63.0Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    R      1.4Mb
    libs  60.6Mb

As per the guidelines for developing R packages that interface with Stan (https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/articles/developer-guidelines.html), all Stan models I have developed for this package are pre-compiled when the package is built. This allows the models to be run on Mac/Windows without a C++ compiler available and speeds up model runtime at the cost of increasing installed package size. I have followed suggested best practices to combine my models into as few Stan model files as possible to speed up compilation and minimize size.

* checking for GNU extensions in Makefiles ... NOTE
  GNU make is a SystemRequirements.

I believe GNU make is required to use Rcpp and compiled Stan code.
